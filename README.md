Policy-driven benchmarking of language models using Stanford HELM evaluations.
# HELM Model Benchmarking for Policy Decisions

This project leverages the HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) benchmarks from Stanford's CRFM to support AI model selection in sensitive government and public policy applications.

## Project Purpose
To demonstrate a policy-driven evaluation of language models based on:
- Accuracy
- Robustness
- Fairness
- Cost efficiency

Use case: selecting a language model for government document summarization, balancing performance, safety, and cost.

## Project Components
- **Data Ingestion:** Extracting HELM evaluation data.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Performance and trade-off analysis across models.
- **Policy Scenario:** Simulating model selection decisions.
- **Dashboard:** Power BI or Plotly Dash for interactive visualizations.
